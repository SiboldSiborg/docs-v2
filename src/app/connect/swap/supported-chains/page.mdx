### Supported chains and currencies for developers

thirdweb Swap currently supports the following chains:

| Blockchain (Mainnet) | Chain ID |
| :------------------- | :------- |
| Optimism             | 10       |
| Polygon              | 137      |

Our goal is to build tools that support any EVM, so please check back as we add more chains. If youâ€™d like to suggest a chain for us to support, [contact us](https://thirdweb.com/contact-us).
