# Swap

Swap handles the complexity of cross-chain swaps and bridges by leveraging several DeFi liquidity providers to find the most affordable and least complex route for any transaction.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Execution:** Use funds on any EVM source chain to execute any transaction on a destination chain (e.g. use Polygon funds to execute a transaction on Optimism).
- **Liquidity Aggregation:** thirdweb utilizes several liquidity providers under the hood to ensure that every swap is possible.
- **Collect Fees**: Configure a percentage fee and destination wallet for your application to take for each transaction.
- **Connect Support:** Built-in support for Swap through our in-app wallet interface.

## Pricing

thirdweb collects .5% and 30Â¢ per Swap transaction.
