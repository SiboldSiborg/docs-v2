# Getting Started

In this guide, we’ll walk you through getting a quote and sending a swap. Once set up, your app will be able to provide cross-chain swapping and bridging for users.

## Starting from existing project

Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install thirdweb
```

## Get your client ID

To start swapping in your applications you will need your client ID. You can get one for free on [your thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

## Getting a Quote

A quote is an object that contains the details around a swap’s route, price, and approval status. Receiving a quote requires the following parameters:

- **fromAddress:** The address of the wallet initiating the swap
- **fromTokenAddress:** The contract address of the source token.
- **fromChainId**: The chain id of the source token.
- **toTokenAddress:** The contract address of the destination token.
- **toChainId:** The chain id of the destination token.
- **client**: A thirdweb client instance instantiated with your client ID.

```ts
import { getSwapRoute } from "thirdweb";

const getQuote = async ({
	fromAddress,
	fromChainId,
	toChainId,
	fromTokenAddress,
	toTokenAddress,
}) => {
	const quote = await getSwapRoute({
		fromAddress,
		fromChainId,
		toChainId,
		fromTokenAddress,
		toTokenAddress,
		client,
	});
	return quote;
};
```

## Sending a Transaction

Once you’ve retrieved the quote for your transaction, you can utilize the `sendSwap` function to initiate the swap with the provided quote parameter:

```ts
import { sendSwap } from "thirdweb";
import { useActiveAccount } from "thirdweb/react";

const onSendTransaction = async (quote) => {
	// Retrieves connected wallet if it exists
	const { activeAccount } = useActiveAccount();

	// Ensure that a quote exists and your wallet is connected.
	if (quote && activeAccount) {
		try {
			// Execute swap based on passed quote
			const swapStatusParams = await sendSwap(activeAccount, quote);
		} catch (error) {
			console.error("Error sending transaction:", error);
		}
	}
};
```

And those are the basics! You’re ready to start sending swaps with thirdweb.
